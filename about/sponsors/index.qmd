## Sponsorship Details

satRday is committed to being an affordable and open conference for all interested R users. To provide highly discounted tickets, we plan to raise \$10,000 with sponsors this year.

Sponsorship price is \$1,000 and includes:

-   Three (3) individual registrations (a \$50 value)
-   Your organization's logo displayed on the conference website and at the beginning of each talk
-   An optional 5-minute slot at the conference where you may talk about how you use R in your organization

Sponsors will benefit from direct access to one of the main organizers to address any questions or extra requests.
